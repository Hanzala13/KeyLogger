Keyloggers are tools that record keystrokes made by users on a keyboard. While often associated with malicious activities, keyloggers also have legitimate uses, such as for monitoring and research purposes. This project focuses on building a keylogger as a part of a cybersecurity learning exercise.

The primary aim is to understand how keyloggers function, explore their potential impact on security and privacy, and highlight the importance of protecting systems against such threats. By developing and analyzing a keylogger, participants will gain hands-on experience with keylogging techniques, ethical hacking principles, and security countermeasures.

### Key points:
* Keylogging Mechanisms: Understanding how keyloggers capture and record keystrokes.
* Data Management: Techniques for securely storing and accessing logged data, including encryption.
* Stealth and Detection: Methods for running keyloggers covertly and detecting their presence on systems.
* Ethical Considerations: Emphasizing the legal and ethical boundaries in cybersecurity, ensuring responsible use of the tool.
