Keyloggers are tools that record keystrokes made by users on a keyboard. While often associated with malicious activities, keyloggers also have legitimate uses, such as for monitoring and research purposes. This project focuses on building a keylogger as a part of a cybersecurity learning exercise.

The primary aim is to understand how keyloggers function, explore their potential impact on security and privacy, and highlight the importance of protecting systems against such threats. By developing and analyzing a keylogger, participants will gain hands-on experience with keylogging techniques, ethical hacking principles, and security countermeasures.

### Key points:
* Keylogging Mechanisms: Understanding how keyloggers capture and record keystrokes.
* Data Management: Techniques for securely storing and accessing logged data, including encryption.
* Stealth and Detection: Methods for running keyloggers covertly and detecting their presence on systems.
* Ethical Considerations: Emphasizing the legal and ethical boundaries in cybersecurity, ensuring responsible use of the tool.

This project showcases a keylogger as part of a cybersecurity learning tool. The keylogger records keystrokes and demonstrates potential security vulnerabilities. The project aims to educate users on cybersecurity threats, ethical hacking, and the importance of securing systems against such threats.

Important: This keylogger is intended strictly for educational purposes within a controlled and legal environment. Unauthorized use on devices or systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Features
* Keystroke Logging: Captures all keystrokes from the keyboard.
* Log Management: Stores captured data in a secure log file.
* Encryption: Supports encryption of log files to protect sensitive data.
* Stealth Mode: Can run silently in the background for demonstration purposes.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x is required.
* Required Python packages:
`pynput` (for capturing keyboard input)

### Installation
Clone the Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Hanzala13/CybersecurityKeylogger.git`

Go to Folder
`cd Cybersecurity-Keylogger`

Install Dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Start the Keylogger:
Launch the keylogger by running:

`python3 main.py`

Stopping the Keylogger:
The process can be stopped using Ctrl+C in the terminal or through task management tools.

Accessing Logs:
Logs are stored in an encrypted file, typically named log.txt. The encryption key must be securely managed and is required to decrypt the logs.

## Ethical Considerations
* Purpose: This tool is developed solely for educational purposes within cybersecurity courses or ethical hacking labs.
* Legality: Unauthorized use of keyloggers is prohibited. Use this tool only on systems where you have explicit permission to test.
* Responsibility: Users are responsible for ensuring their actions comply with applicable laws and ethical standards.
